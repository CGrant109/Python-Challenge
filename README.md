Python-Challenge: A Deep-Dive on Financial Earnings and Election Results

## Description: 
Welcome! This project is an activity to exemplify the many powerful tools and purposes of using Python in the data science community.
Within "PyBank", users will review a financial anaylysis of profits/losses encountered throughout 86 months in 2010 to 2017. Users will find the total sum of the profits/losses throughout this period, as well as recognizing the average change and the greatest increase as well as decrease in profits.

Within "PyPoll", users will review electoral candidates and their voting results within various counties. Users will be able to recognize the total number of votes,
a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage and number of votes each candidate received, as well as the determining winner of the election.

## Installation:
VS Code, Gitbash, Python are required

## Limitations:
Due to time restraints, I was unable to complete the assignment for PyPoll. Issues encountered were developing a correct for loop that added and provided the results of each candidate into a list for further valuation and determination of a winner. I do plan to return and re-submit this project at a future date.
